# STM32F105_CAN_HACK

üöó A USB-to-CAN interface firmware developed for the STM32F105, fully compatible with **CarBUSAnalyzer** (also known as **CAN-Hacker / Car-Hack**).

This project allows you to build your own open-source CAN interface using STM32 microcontrollers. The firmware enables communication with the CarBUSAnalyzer desktop application, replicating the functionality of commercial USB-CAN adapters.

## üì¶ Project Structure

- `Core/` ‚Äì Firmware source code generated with STM32CubeIDE and STM32CubeMX
- `Drivers/` ‚Äì HAL and CMSIS drivers for STM32F105
- `CarBUSAnalyzer/` ‚Äì A full copy of the **CarBUSAnalyzer (CAN-Hacker)** Windows software
- `.ioc` ‚Äì CubeMX configuration file

---

## üß† Features

- Compatible with **CarBUSAnalyzer / CAN-Hacker** software
- Developed for **STM32F105**, but easily portable to other STM32 MCUs
- Baudrate and CAN channel configuration supported
- Uses native USB for high-speed communication
- Fully functional for both **receiving and transmitting** CAN frames

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)
- [STM32 HAL Drivers](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-packages.html)
- [CarBUSAnalyzer (CAN-Hacker)](https://canhacker.com/) ‚Äì Bundled inside this repo

## üîç Reverse Engineering

To ensure full compatibility with **CarBUSAnalyzer**, this firmware was **built** using **reverse engineering techniques**.

- USB communication was captured using **Wireshark**
- Protocol details (commands, responses, frame formats) were manually decoded
- The firmware was built to **emulate the original protocol**, ensuring seamless operation with the official software
